## Shiny new things

### All-new Project and Workflow Management

We've rebuilt the underlying logic for tasks, projects, and contexts to introduce powerful workflow management features. You can now:
- **Folder as Project**: Directly manage folders as projects.
- **Project Configuration**: Configure all project-related settings in one place within the project settings.
- **Workflows**: Define clear workflow stages for your projects and easily move tasks between them.

### Timeline Sidebar View

Introducing a brand new **Timeline view** in the sidebar, allowing you to visualize and plan your schedule more intuitively.

### File and Canvas Task Indexing

You can now track an entire note file or Canvas as a single task, greatly expanding the boundaries of task management. Relevant metadata is automatically indexed from the file.

### Matrix View (Eisenhower Matrix)

Introducing the new **Matrix view** based on the Eisenhower Matrix methodology, where you can organize and prioritize your tasks across four quadrants: Urgent & Important, Not Urgent & Important, Urgent & Not Important, and Not Urgent & Not Important. Tasks can be dragged and dropped between quadrants for intuitive priority management.
