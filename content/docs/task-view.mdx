title: Task Genius View
---

The Task Genius View provides a powerful, centralized dashboard to manage all your tasks across your entire Obsidian vault.

## Opening the View

Access the view using one of these methods:

- Click the dedicated **Ribbon Icon** (if enabled in settings).
- Run the command `Task Genius: Open Task Genius view` from the Obsidian command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`).

## Interface Overview

The view typically consists of:

- **Left Panel/Sidebar**: Navigation controls to switch between different modes or views.
- **Main Panel**: Displays the list of tasks based on the current mode and filters.
- **Right Panel (Details Panel)**: Shows detailed information and allows editing of the currently selected task.

## Modes

The Task Genius View offers several modes to organize and visualize your tasks:

- **Inbox**: Shows tasks recently captured or those that haven't been processed or assigned specific metadata (like projects or dates).
- **Forecast / Upcoming**: Displays tasks with upcoming due dates, often grouped by day or week.
- **Tags**: Groups tasks based on the tags associated with them.
- **Projects**: Groups tasks based on associated project notes or project tags/metadata.
- **Review**: Helps you review completed tasks or tasks needing attention.
- _(Other custom views or filters might be available depending on configuration)_

## Interacting with Tasks

Within the view, you can:

- **View/Edit Details**: Click on a task in the main panel to see its full description, due date, priority, notes, source file link, etc., in the right details panel. You can often edit these details directly.
- **Change Status**: Click the task marker (e.g., `[ ]`) directly in the task list to cycle its status or mark it complete.
- **Sort & Filter**: Use controls within the view to sort tasks (by priority, due date, etc.) and apply filters (by tag, status, date range, etc.).
- **Context Menu**: Right-click on a task in the list to access relevant actions (e.g., set priority, set due date, move task, go to source note).

## Task Indexing

The view relies on an index of tasks from your vault. This index usually updates automatically in the background.

- **Manual Refresh**: If the view seems out of sync, use commands like:
  - `Task Genius: Refresh task index`
  - `Task Genius: Force reindex all tasks` (more thorough, might take longer)

## Customization

Explore the Task Genius settings to customize the view's appearance, available modes, default sorting/filtering, and indexing behavior.
