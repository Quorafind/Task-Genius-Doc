Task Genius includes a powerful workflow system to help you manage multi-stage tasks and processes directly within Obsidian, tracking their progression through different phases.

<VersionCallout version="6.0.0" />

## Usage

1.  **Associate Task with Workflow:** Mark a root task with a workflow tag, like `#workflow/YourWorkflowID`. This task represents the start of the process.

    ```markdown
    - [ ] Start Project Alpha #workflow/project_workflow
    ```

2.  **Initial Stage & Stage Markers:**

    - When you interact with the root task (e.g., via context menu), the plugin might automatically create the first stage task.
    - Subsequent stages and substages are typically marked using `[stage::StageID]` or `[stage::ParentStageID.SubStageID]`.

    ```markdown
    - [x] Start Project Alpha #workflow/project_workflow 🛫 2024-03-20 10:00:00
      - [x] Planning Phase [stage::planning] (⏱️ 02:15:30)
      - [ ] Development [stage::in_progress] 🛫 2024-03-20 12:15:30
        - [x] Coding [stage::in_progress.development] (⏱️ 01:30:00)
        - [x] Code Review [stage::in_progress.review] (⏱️ 00:30:00)
        - [ ] Testing [stage::in_progress.testing] 🛫 2024-03-20 15:15:30
    ```

3.  **Transitioning Stages:**

    - **Context Menu:** Right-click on a task associated with a workflow. Choose options like "Move to [Next Stage Name]", select from available stages defined in `canProceedTo` or "Complete Stage".
    - **Task Completion:** Completing a task (`- [x]`) associated with a non-terminal stage can trigger automatic transitions.
    - **Manual Editing:** You can manually change the `[stage::...]` marker, although using the context menu or task completion is recommended for consistency and triggering automation.

4.  **Automation:** Based on your configuration (see "Configuration Options" above), actions like adding timestamps, calculating spent time, removing markers, and creating the next task will happen automatically during stage transitions or completions.

## Settings

Activate and customize workflow behavior in the plugin settings:

1.  Go to `Settings` -> `Task Genius` -> `Workflow`.
2.  Toggle **Enable workflow** on.

### Configuration options

Fine-tune how workflows operate:

- **Auto-add timestamp:** Automatically append a timestamp (e.g., `🛫 2024-01-01 10:00:00`) to a task when it enters a workflow stage or is created within one.
  - **Timestamp format:** Define the date/time format using Moment.js tokens (default: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`).
  - **Remove timestamp when moving to next stage:** Delete the timestamp from the task when it transitions to the next workflow stage.
- **Calculate spent time:** Track the time a task spends in a stage. When the task moves, append the duration (e.g., `(⏱️ 01:30:00)`).
  - **Spent time format:** Define the format for the duration (default: `HH:mm:ss`).
  - **Calculate full spent time:** Track the total time from the _start_ of the workflow to the _completion_ of the final stage. Adds a total duration marker (e.g., `(Total: 05:45:10)`) to the final task.
- **Auto remove last stage marker:** When a task marked with the _final_ stage of its workflow is completed (`- [x]`), automatically remove the stage marker text (e.g., `[stage::stage_id]`).

### Workflow definitions

Workflows are defined as templates specifying a sequence of stages. Manage them in `Settings` -> `Task Genius` -> `Workflow`:

- Click `Add New Workflow` to define a new template.
- Click the pencil icon (<Edit3Icon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />) to edit an existing one.
- Click the trash icon (<TrashIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />) to delete a definition.

### Defining Stages

When creating or editing a workflow:

- **Name & Description:** Identify the workflow.
- **Stages:** Add, remove, and reorder stages.
  - **ID:** A unique identifier for the stage (e.g., `planning`, `dev`, `review`) used in the task line, for example `[stage::planning]`.
  - **Name:** The display name for the stage (e.g., "Planning", "Development", "Review"). This is used as the stage display name (not in task line).
  - **Type:**
    - `Linear`: Moves strictly to the stage defined in its `next` property.
    - `Cycle`: Can loop back or move to multiple stages defined in `canProceedTo`. May contain `subStages` for nested steps.
    - `Terminal`: Represents a final state (e.g., "Completed", "Cancelled"). Tasks entering a terminal stage typically conclude their workflow path.
  - **Next (for Linear):** The ID of the single stage that follows this one, for example `[stage::in_progress]`.
  - **SubStages (for Cycle):** Define nested steps within a cycle stage. Each substage has its own `id`, `name`, and optional `next` (pointing to the next substage ID within the cycle), for example `[stage::in_progress.development]` and `[stage::in_progress.review]`.
  - **CanProceedTo (for Cycle/Linear):** A list of stage IDs that a task can transition to from this stage (used in the context menu). This allows for branching or returning to earlier stages or going to next main stage (when in `Cycle` type stage).
