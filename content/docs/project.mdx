Projects let you organize and surface work using metadata-based detection.

## Detection Methods

Enable and configure how files become projects:

- Frontmatter key: e.g. `project: true`
- Tags: One or more tags to qualify files as projects
- Folders: Paths designating project locations

You can combine methods to match your vault structure.

## Metadata Configuration

- Property keys: Define which frontmatter keys store project metadata
- Status mapping: Map project-level states to status icons/labels
- Display options: Icons, names, and how projects appear in views

## Working With Projects in Views

- Projects appear alongside tasks and files where supported
- Filtering rules can include/exclude projects
- Consider using separate views for project dashboards vs. task lists

## Tips

- Keep project detection conditions simple for maintainability
- Standardize metadata keys across your vault for consistency

## Troubleshooting

- Project not detected? Check the configured methods and the fileâ€™s frontmatter/tags/folder path
- Conflicting methods? Narrow down criteria or prioritize one method
