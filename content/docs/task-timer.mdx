The Task Timer lets you track time spent on tasks, export/import timer data, and show formatted durations in your notes.

## Enable the Task Timer

- Go to Obsidian → Settings → Task Genius → Task Timer
- Toggle “Enable Task Timer”

Once enabled, additional options for detection and formatting appear.

## Metadata Detection

Task Timer can automatically enable for specific files using simple metadata rules:

- Frontmatter field: Name of a boolean field in frontmatter that enables the timer (e.g. `task-timer: true`)
- Folder paths: Comma-separated list of folders where the timer is active
- Tags: Comma-separated list of tags that enable the timer

Tip: You can mix these to control scope precisely.

## Time Format Template

Customize how durations render using tokens:

- {h} = hours
- {m} = minutes
- {s} = seconds

Examples:

- {h}hrs{m}mins → 2hrs30mins
- {h}h {m}m {s}s → 2h 30m 45s
- {h}:{m}:{s} → 2:30:45
- ({m}mins) → (150mins)

## Block References

Choose a prefix for generated block reference IDs (e.g. `timer` generates IDs like `^timer-123456-7890`).

## Data Management Commands

Use the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+P) to:

- Export task timer data
- Import task timer data
- Export task timer data (YAML)
- Create task timer backup
- Show task timer statistics

## Troubleshooting

- Timer not appearing? Ensure it’s enabled and your file matches the detection rules (frontmatter/folder/tags)
- Unexpected format output? Double-check the time format template tokens

## Best Practices

- Keep detection rules as narrow as needed to reduce noise
- Choose a consistent time format for better readability across notes
- Use exports/backups for periodic snapshots of your work
