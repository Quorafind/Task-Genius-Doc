List item is the basic unit of the task view. It is a single task that is displayed in the list view.

<VersionCallout version="7.0.0" />

## Task List Item

This component is responsible for rendering a single task item within the task list view. It displays task details like content, dates, priority, tags, and handles user interactions.

<ListItem />

Contains the following information:

- Task checkbox
- Task content
- Task dates
- Task priority
- Task tags
- Task project

### Rendering Principles

- **Task Checkbox**: Displays the task's completion status (`Status`). Clicking it triggers the completion logic. The entire item gets a `task-completed` class if the task is marked as done.
- **Task Content**: Renders the `Original Markdown` using Task Genius's Markdown renderer that extends Obsidian's Markdown renderer, preserving formatting and links.
- **Task Dates**:
  - **Incomplete Tasks**: Shows Due, Scheduled, and Start dates if available. Due dates are styled differently if they are overdue, due today, or due tomorrow. Recurrence rules are also shown if present.
  - **Completed Tasks**: Shows Completion and Created dates if available.
  - **Relative Time**: Dates can be displayed using relative time (e.g., "in 2 days", "yesterday") based on the `Use Relative Time` setting. (Available in Task Genius [8.6.0+](/changelog/2025-05-04-desktop-v8.6.0))
- **Task Priority**: If `Priority` is set (1, 2, or 3), an indicator (eg, `!`, `!!`, `!!!`) is displayed, styled with a corresponding CSS class (`priority-1`, `priority-2`, `priority-3`).
- **Task Tags**: If `Tags` exist, each tag is displayed, prefixed with `#`.
- **Task Project**: If `Project` exists and the current view is not the project view (`viewMode !== 'projects'`), the project name (typically the last part of the path) is displayed.
