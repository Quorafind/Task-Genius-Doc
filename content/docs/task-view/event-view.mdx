The Event View provides a calendar-based interface to visualize and interact with your tasks. It allows you to see tasks plotted on different time scales, navigate through dates, and perform actions directly from the calendar.

<VersionCallout version="8.0.0" />

## Open the event view

1. Open the [Task Genius View](/docs/task-view/index).
2. Select `Event` nav item in the left sidebar.
3. You will see the tasks grouped by event in the right panel.

## Usage

The Event View offers several ways to look at your tasks:

- **Multiple views:** Switch between different perspectives:
  - <GanttChartSquare className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> **Year view:** Get a high-level
    overview of the entire year.
  - <CalendarDays className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> **Month view:** See tasks laid
    out across a specific month.
  - <CalendarDays className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> **Week view:** Focus on the
    current or selected week.
  - <Clock className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> **Day view:** Examine tasks scheduled
    for a single day.
  - <ListChecks className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> **Agenda view:** View upcoming
    tasks in a list format.
- **Navigation:** Easily move through time:
  - <ChevronLeft className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> **Previous**/**Next** <ChevronRight className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />
    : Navigate to the previous or next year, month, week, or day depending on the
    active view.
  - <CalendarCheck2 className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> **Today:** Quickly jump back
    to the current date.
- **View switching:** Use the buttons or dropdown in the header to select your preferred view (`Year`, `Month`, `Week`, `Day`, `Agenda`). Your last used view is remembered.
- **Date display:** The header clearly shows the currently displayed date range, adapting its format based on the active view (e.g., "MMMM YYYY" for Month view, "MMM D - D, YYYY" for Week view).

## Task Display

Tasks are processed and displayed on the calendar as events:

- **Date mapping:** Tasks are primarily placed on the calendar based on their `Due date`. If `Due date` is not available, it will fall back to `Scheduled date` and then `Start date`. Tasks without any of these dates are currently not displayed in the calendar view.
- **All-day events:** By default, tasks are treated as all-day events on their assigned date.
- **Multi-day events:** If a task has both a `Start date` and a `Due date` that are different, it will be displayed spanning across those days (inclusive).
- **Completed tasks:** Completed tasks are visually distinct (e.g., shown in grey).

## Interactions

You can interact with the calendar in various ways:

- **Clicking an event:** Selects the corresponding task, will open the task in the detail side panel.
- **Clicking a day (Month/Week view):**
  - Can be configured to open the Quick Capture modal to quickly add a task for that day.
  - Can switch the view to the Day view for the selected date (Note: This is not yet implemented).
- **Clicking a month (Year view):** Switches the view to the Month view for the selected month.
- **Right-clicking an event:** Opens a context menu with relevant actions for that task.
- **Completing an event:** A mechanism (like a checkbox on the event, depending on the view) allows marking the task as complete directly from the calendar.

## Settings

You can read more about the settings in the [Basic view settings](/docs/task-view/basic-view-settings#basic-settings) page.

Event view has a special setting:

`First day of week`: This setting determines the first day of the week for the calendar. It can be set to any day of the week.
