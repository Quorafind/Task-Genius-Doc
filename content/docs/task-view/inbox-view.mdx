The Inbox View is a built-in view that displays tasks based on specific criteria, acting as a central place to process incoming or unfiltered tasks. It utilizes a flexible content component that supports various display and filtering options.

<VersionCallout version="7.0.0" />

## Open the inbox view

1. Open the [Task Genius View](/docs/task-view/index).
2. Select `Inbox` nav item in the left sidebar.
3. You will see the tasks grouped by inbox in the right panel.

## Usage

- **Task Display**: Shows tasks that match its configured filter rules. By default, it might show tasks without project tags.
- **Filtering**:
  - **Text Filter**: A search bar in the header allows for quick filtering of displayed tasks by their content (case-insensitive).
  - **Rule-Based Filtering**: Applies predefined filter rules ([see settings](#settings)) to determine which tasks are initially loaded into the view.
- **View Modes**:
  - **List View** (<ListIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />): Displays tasks as a flat list.
  - **Tree View** (<GitBranchIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />): Displays tasks hierarchically, showing parent-child relationships. You can toggle between these modes using the list/branch icon in the header.
- **Task Count**: The header displays the current number of tasks visible after applying filters.
- **Sorting**: Tasks are automatically sorted based on the following order:
  1.  Completion status (incomplete tasks first).
  2.  Priority (higher priority first).
  3.  Due Date (earlier dates first).
  4.  Task content (alphabetical).
- **Interactions**:
  - **Selection**: Click on a task to select it (used for detail views or actions).
  - **Completion**: Mark tasks as complete directly within the view.
  - **Context Menu**: Right-click on a task to open a context menu for more actions.
- **Lazy Loading**: For performance with large numbers of tasks, the view loads tasks in batches as you scroll down.
