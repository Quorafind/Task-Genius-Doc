import { VersionCallout } from "@/components/VersionCallout";

Task Genius uses an indexer to index your tasks. Basically, it's a process that runs in the background to index your tasks.

<VersionCallout version="7.0.0" />

## How it works

When you enable the Task Genius View, the indexer will start indexing your tasks. And it uses indexedDB to store all the indexed data.

If you find that the indexer is not working, you can try to force it to reindex by running the command `Task Genius: Force reindex all tasks`. Or trying to reload Obsidian.

## How to disable it

You can disable the indexer by disabling the Task Genius View.

## Settings

Currently, the indexer is not configurable except for the metadata format.

### Tasks format

This is from the [Tasks](https://obsidian.md/plugins/tasks) plugin. It is a plugin that provides a task management system in Obsidian.

And you can select `Tasks` format to match emoji type metadata (e.g. `ðŸ›« 2025-01-01`) or `#project/hello-world` for project type metadata.

### Dataview format

This is from the [Dataview](https://obsidian.md/plugins/dataview) plugin. It is a plugin that provides full data indexing and viewing in Obsidian.

And you can select `Dataview` format to match the format of Dataview (e.g. `[due:: 2025-01-01]` or `[project:: hello-world]`).
