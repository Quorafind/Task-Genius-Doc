The Status View displays your tasks in a Kanban board format, organized into columns based on their status. This allows for a visual workflow management where you can easily track task progress.

<VersionCallout version="8.0.0" />

## Open the status view

1. Open the [Task Genius View](/docs/task-view).
2. Select `Status` nav item in the left sidebar.
3. You will see the tasks grouped by status in the right panel.

## Usage

### Columns

- Each column represents a specific task status defined in your settings (e.g., "Todo", "In Progress", "Done"). Based on the status of task itself.
- The order of the columns follows the `taskStatusCycle` setting, typically grouping standard statuses, then custom statuses, and finally completed statuses (marked with 'x').
- Tasks within each column are sorted primarily by priority (highest first) and secondarily by due date (earliest first).

### Drag and Drop

- You can move tasks between columns by clicking and dragging them.
- Dropping a task into a new column will update the task's status to match the status of that column.
- Visual indicators appear during dragging to show where the task will be placed.

### Filtering

Above the Kanban board, filter controls allow you to narrow down the displayed tasks.

<VersionCallout version="8.0.0" />

1. Click the <PlusIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> **Add filter** button to open a dropdown.
2. Select a **category** to filter by (e.g., `Tag`, `Priority`, `Project`).
3. Select the specific **value** within that category (e.g., `#urgent`, `üî∫ Highest`, `MyProject`).
4. Available filter categories and options are dynamically generated based on the tasks currently loaded.
5. Active filters are displayed as removable "pills" above the board (via <XIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />).
6. You can add multiple filters. Tasks must match **all** active filters to be displayed.
7. Click the **Clear all** button to remove all active filters at once.
8. The filterable criteria include:

- Status
- Tag
- Project
- Context
- Priority (often represented by icons like üî∫, ‚è´, üîº)
- Completed (Yes/No)
- File Path

9. Applying, adding, or removing filters dynamically updates the Kanban board.
