The Forecast View provides a calendar-based perspective on your tasks, showing items with upcoming scheduled or due dates.

<VersionCallout version="7.0.0" />

## Open the forecast view

1.  Open the [Task Genius View](/docs/task-view).
2.  Select `Forecast` in the sidebar.
3.  The Forecast View will load, displaying the calendar, task stats, upcoming tasks, and the main task list.

## Usage

### Header Bar

The header bar at the top of the Task Panel displays key information and controls:

- **Title:** Shows "Forecast".
- **Task & Project Count:** Displays the total number of tasks loaded and the number of unique projects they belong to (e.g., "15 tasks, 3 projects").
- **View Toggle:** Switches the Task Panel between List view (<ListIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />) and Tree view (<GitBranchIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />).
- **Sidebar Toggle (Mobile):** On mobile devices, a <SidebarIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> icon appears to show/hide the Left Sidebar.

### Left Sidebar

The left sidebar contains navigation and overview components:

#### Stats Bar

Located above the calendar, this bar shows counts for tasks categorized by their relevant date (Scheduled or Due):

- **Past Due:** Count of tasks whose relevant date is before today.
- **Today:** Count of tasks whose relevant date is today.
- **Future:** Count of tasks whose relevant date is after today.

Clicking on any of these stats will filter the Task Panel to show only tasks in that category. Click again to remove the filter.

#### Calendar Component

Displays a monthly calendar.

- Days with tasks are marked.
- Clicking a date selects it, updating the "Coming Up" section and the Task Panel to show tasks relevant to that date and beyond.
- The current date is highlighted.

#### Coming Up Component

Below the calendar, this section lists tasks with relevant dates occurring in the 15 days _after_ the date currently selected in the calendar.

- Each entry shows the day of the week, date (e.g., "Mon, Jan 1"), and the number of tasks for that day.
- Clicking an entry selects that date in the calendar.
- On mobile, a close button (<XIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />) is available to hide the sidebar.

### Task Panel

The main panel on the right displays the tasks organized by date.

#### Date Sections

Tasks are grouped into collapsible sections based on their relevant date:

- **Past Due:** Contains all tasks with a relevant date before today. This section appears first if the selected date is today or in the future.
- **Selected Date Section:** Shows tasks for the date selected in the calendar. The title format depends on the selected date relative to today (e.g., "Today — January 1, 2024", "Tomorrow, Tuesday, January 2, 2024", "Wednesday, January 3, 2024").
- **Future Date Sections:** Shows tasks for dates after the selected date. Sections for the next 7 days after the selected date are expanded by default.

Each section header displays:

- An expand/collapse toggle (<ChevronDownIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> / <ChevronRightIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />).
- The section title (e.g., "Past Due", "Today — ...").
- A badge showing the number of tasks in that section.

#### View Mode

The **View Toggle** button in the Header Bar switches this panel between:

- **List View (<ListIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />):** Shows tasks as a flat list within each date section.
- **Tree View (<GitBranchIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />):** Organizes tasks hierarchically based on parent tasks or project structure (if applicable).

#### Task Sorting

Within each date section, tasks are automatically sorted first by **Priority** (highest to lowest) and then by their **Relevant Date** (earliest to latest).

#### Relevant Date Logic

The view uses the `scheduledDate` of a task if available. If a task has no `scheduledDate`, it uses the `dueDate`. Tasks without either date are not displayed in the Forecast View.
