The Advanced Filter is a powerful tool that allows you to filter tasks based on complex criteria.

<VersionCallout version="8.0.0" />

## Scope

Currently, the advanced filter is only available in the [Plan(Gantt) view](/docs/task-view/plan-view) and also the [Status(Kanban) view](/docs/task-view/status-view).

## Usage

1. Click the <PlusIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> **Add filter** button to open a dropdown.
2. Select a **category** to filter by (e.g., `Tag`, `Priority`, `Project`).
3. Select the specific **value** within that category (e.g., `#urgent`, `🔺 Highest`, `MyProject`).
4. Available filter categories and options are dynamically generated based on the tasks currently loaded.
5. Active filters are displayed as removable "pills" above the board (via <XIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />).
6. You can add multiple filters. Tasks must match **all** active filters to be displayed.
7. Click the **Clear all** button to remove all active filters at once.
8. The filterable criteria include:

- Status
- Tag
- Project
- Context
- Priority (often represented by icons like 🔺, ⏫, 🔼)
- Completed (Yes/No)
- File Path

9. Applying, adding, or removing filters dynamically updates the tasks in the view.
