title: Basic Filter

import { VersionCallout } from "@/components/VersionCallout";

The basic filter is a simple filter that allows you to filter tasks by content.

<VersionCallout version="8.0.0" />

## Scope

Currently, the basic filter is available in all views(except the [Plan(Gantt) view](/docs/task-view/plan-view) or [Status(Kanban) view](/docs/task-view/status-view)).

## Usage

You can find the basic filter in the top right corner of the view. When you input a keyword, the tasks that contain the keyword will be filtered.
