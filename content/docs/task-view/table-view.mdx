The Table View provides a comprehensive tabular interface for viewing, editing, and managing your tasks in Task Genius. It offers powerful features like sorting, filtering, inline editing, and both flat and hierarchical tree views.

## Open the Table View

1. Open the [Task Genius View](/docs/task-view).
2. Select the `Table` nav item in the left sidebar.
3. The Table View will load, displaying your tasks in a structured table format.

## Usage

The Table View presents your tasks in a spreadsheet-like interface with powerful data management capabilities.

The view consists of:

1. **Table Header Bar:** Contains controls for view mode toggle (flat/tree), and column visibility settings.
2. **Table Headers:** Column headers that support sorting (click to sort) and resizing (drag column borders).
3. **Table Body:** The main area displaying task data in rows and columns.
4. **Selection Controls:** Support for single and multi-row selection using click and Ctrl/Cmd+click.

### Available Columns

The table supports various column types that can be shown or hidden:

- **Status:** Task completion status with visual indicators
- **Content:** Task description and details
- **Priority:** Task priority level (High, Medium, Low)
- **Due Date:** When the task is due
