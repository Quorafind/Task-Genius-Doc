The Review View helps you systematically review tasks on a project-by-project basis according to a defined schedule. It allows you to configure review frequencies for each project and keeps track of when each project was last reviewed.

<VersionCallout version="7.0.0" />

## Open the review view

1. Open the [Task Genius View](/docs/task-view/index).
2. Select `Review` nav item in the left sidebar.
3. You will see the tasks grouped by project in the right panel.

## Usage

The Review View features a two-column layout:

1.  **Project Sidebar (Left):** Lists all projects containing tasks.
2.  **Task Review Area (Right):** Displays tasks for the selected project and provides review controls.

On mobile devices, the Project Sidebar is initially hidden and can be toggled using the <SidebarIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />.

### Project Sidebar

The sidebar lists your projects, grouped into two sections:

- **Configured for Review:** Projects for which you have set a review schedule. These projects have a <FolderCheckIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />. Projects due for review according to their schedule are highlighted.
- **Not Configured:** Projects without a review schedule. These projects have a <FolderIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />.

Clicking on a project name in the sidebar selects it for review in the right-hand area.

### Task Review Area

When you select a project, this area displays its details and tasks.

#### Header

The header shows:

- **Project Title:** The name of the selected project.
- **Review Information:**
  - If configured: The review frequency (e.g., "Review every weekly") and the date it was last reviewed (e.g., "Last reviewed: 1/1/2024"). Clicking the frequency text opens the configuration modal.
  - If not configured: A message indicating "No review schedule configured for this project".
- **Action Button:**
  - If configured: A "**Mark as Reviewed**" button.
  - If not configured: A "**Configure Review Schedule**" button.

#### Configuring the Review Schedule

You can configure the review schedule for a project by:

1.  Clicking the "**Configure Review Schedule**" button (for unconfigured projects).
2.  Clicking the frequency text in the header (for already configured projects).

This opens a modal where you can set:

- **Review Frequency:** Choose from predefined options (daily, weekly, every 2 weeks, monthly, quarterly, every 6 months, yearly) or select "Custom..." to define your own (e.g., "every 10 days").
- The modal also displays when the project was last reviewed.

#### Task List & Filtering

By default, when you select a project that has been reviewed before, the task list is filtered to show only:

- Tasks created _after_ the last review date.
- Tasks that existed during the last review but were _not completed_ then and are _still not completed_.
- Tasks that were _not part of the last review_ (e.g., older tasks added to the project later).

Completed tasks from the previous review session are hidden by default to focus your attention on what's new or still pending.

- A message like "Showing new and in-progress tasks only. X completed tasks from previous reviews are hidden." will appear below the header.
- You can click "**Show all tasks**" to disable this filter and view every task in the project, including previously reviewed and completed ones.
- Click "**Show only new and in-progress tasks**" to re-enable the default filter.

If a project has never been reviewed, all its tasks are shown initially.

#### Marking a Project as Reviewed

Clicking the "**Mark as Reviewed**" button performs two actions:

1.  Updates the "Last Reviewed" timestamp for the project to the current date and time.
2.  Records the IDs of all tasks currently associated with the project (regardless of whether they are visible due to filtering). This list is used for filtering in subsequent reviews.

After marking as reviewed, the task list will refresh based on the default filtering logic (hiding completed tasks from the review you just finished).

## Settings

You can read more about the settings in the [Basic view settings](/docs/task-view/basic-view-settings#basic-settings) page.
