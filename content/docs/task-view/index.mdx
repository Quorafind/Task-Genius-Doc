The Task Genius View provides a powerful, centralized dashboard to manage all your tasks across your entire Obsidian vault.

<VersionCallout version="7.0.0" />

## Indexer

Task Genius uses the [Indexer](docs/view/indexer) to index your tasks across your entire Obsidian vault. All tasks are indexed by default.

## Opening the View

Access the view using one of these methods:

- Click the dedicated **Ribbon Icon** (if enabled in settings).
- Run the command `Task Genius: Open Task Genius view` from the Obsidian command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`).

## Interface Overview

The view typically consists of:

- **Left Panel/Sidebar**: Navigation controls to switch between different views.
- **Main Panel**: Displays the [list of tasks](/docs/task-view/list-item) based on the current mode and filters. (You can filter by tags, projects, status, etc.)
- **Right Panel (Details Panel)**: Shows detailed information and allows editing of the currently selected task.

## Views

The Task Genius View offers several views to organize and visualize your tasks:

<Cards>

    href="/docs/task-view/inbox-view"
    description="Shows tasks recently captured or those that haven't been processed or assigned specific metadata (like projects or dates)."

</Cards>

## Interacting with Tasks

Within the view, you can:

- **View/Edit Details**: Click on a task in the main panel to see its full description, due date, priority, notes, source file link, etc., in the right details panel. You can often edit these details directly.
- **Change Status**: Click the task marker (e.g., `[ ]`) directly in the task list to cycle its status or mark it complete.
- **Sort & Filter**: Use controls within the view to sort tasks (by priority, due date, etc.) and apply filters (by tag, status, date range, etc.).
- **Context Menu**: Right-click on a task in the list to access relevant actions (e.g., set priority, set due date, move task, go to source note).

## Task Indexing

The view relies on an index of tasks from your vault. This index usually updates automatically in the background.

- **Manual Refresh**: If the view seems out of sync, use commands like:
  - `Task Genius: Refresh task index`
  - `Task Genius: Force reindex all tasks` (more thorough, might take longer)

You can read more about the task indexing in the [Task Indexing](/docs/task-view/indexer) page.
