The Task Genius View provides a powerful, centralized dashboard to manage all your tasks across your entire Obsidian vault.

## Architecture

Task Genius uses the modern **Dataflow Architecture** for optimal performance and flexibility:

- **Event-driven System**: Real-time updates across all views
- **Multi-source Support**: Seamlessly integrates file tasks, ICS calendar events, and file-level tasks
- **Smart Caching**: Fast startup with persisted state and incremental updates
- **Worker Processing**: Parallel processing for large vaults
- **Bases Compatible**: All views can be used within Obsidian Bases for enhanced data visualization

The system automatically indexes your tasks and keeps them synchronized across all views.

## Opening the View

Access the view using one of these methods:

- Click the dedicated **Ribbon Icon** (if enabled in settings).
- Run the command `Task Genius: Open Task Genius view` from the Obsidian command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`).

## Interface Overview

The view typically consists of:

- **Left Panel/Sidebar**: Navigation controls to switch between different views.
- **Main Panel**: Displays the [list of tasks](/docs/task-view/list-item) based on the current mode and filters. (You can filter by tags, projects, status, etc.)
- **Right Panel (Details Panel)**: Shows detailed information and allows editing of the currently selected task.

## Views

The Task Genius View offers several views to organize and visualize your tasks:

<Cards>

</Cards>

## Interacting with Tasks

Within the view, you can:

- **View/Edit Details**: Click on a task in the main panel to see its full description, due date, priority, notes, source file link, etc., in the right details panel. You can often edit these details directly.
- **Change Status**: Click the task marker (e.g., `[ ]`) directly in the task list to cycle its status or mark it complete.
- **Sort & Filter**: Use controls within the view to sort tasks (by priority, due date, etc.) and apply filters (by tag, status, date range, etc.).
- **Context Menu**: Right-click on a task in the list to access relevant actions (e.g., set priority, set due date, move task, go to source note).

## Task Indexing

The Dataflow architecture maintains a high-performance index of all tasks:

### Automatic Updates
- **Real-time Monitoring**: File changes trigger instant updates
- **Event-driven Sync**: All views stay synchronized automatically
- **Background Processing**: Workers handle large operations without blocking

### Data Sources
- **File Tasks**: Regular tasks from Markdown and Canvas files
- **ICS Events**: External calendar events displayed as tasks
- **File-level Tasks**: Entire files recognized as tasks based on metadata
- **Bases Integration**: Native Obsidian file indexing for notes as tasks ([Learn more](/docs/bases-support))

### Manual Controls
If needed, you can manually refresh the index:
- `Task Genius: Refresh task index` - Quick refresh
- `Task Genius: Force reindex all tasks` - Complete rebuild

Learn more in the [Task Indexing](/docs/task-view/indexer) documentation.
