title: Progress Bars
---

Task Genius automatically adds progress indicators to parent items (tasks, list items, or even headings) based on the completion status of their direct sub-tasks or nested sub-items.

## Example

```markdown
- [ ] Parent Task [||||----] [4/8] // Example progress bar and text
  - [x] Sub-task 1
  - [x] Sub-task 2
  - [/] Sub-task 3 (In Progress)
  - [ ] Sub-task 4
  - [-] Sub-task 5 (Abandoned - might be excluded from count based on settings)
  - [?] Sub-task 6 (Planned - might be excluded)
  - [x] Sub-task 7
  - [x] Sub-task 8
```

## Customization

You can heavily customize the appearance and behavior of progress bars in the plugin settings:

- **Display Mode**: Choose between a graphical bar (`[||||----]`), text (`[4/8]`), both, or none.
- **Counting**: Configure which sub-item statuses count towards completion (e.g., exclude `[-]` or `[?]`). Decide whether to count only direct children or all nested sub-items.
- **Target Items**: Enable/disable progress bars on regular list items, headings, or only task items.
- **Text Format**: Customize the text display using placeholders (like `{done}`, `{total}`, `{perc}`) and simple expressions.
- **Conditional Hiding**: Hide progress bars based on specific tags, parent tags, file paths, or frontmatter metadata.
