1.  Download the latest release files (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`) from the [Task Genius Releases page](https://github.com/Quorafind/Obsidian-Task-Genius/releases) on GitHub.
2.  Navigate to your Obsidian vault's plugins folder. This is usually located at `YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/` (Note: `.obsidian` might be a hidden folder).
3.  Create a new folder inside the `plugins` directory named exactly `task-genius`.
4.  Copy the downloaded `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` files directly into this new `task-genius` folder.
5.  Reload Obsidian (Close and reopen the app, or use the command `Reload app without saving`).
6.  Go back to `Settings` -> `Community plugins` and enable "Task Genius".
