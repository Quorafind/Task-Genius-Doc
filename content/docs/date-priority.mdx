title: Date & Priority management
---

Task Genius provides intuitive ways to add and manage due dates and priorities for your tasks directly within Obsidian notes.

## Due dates

Assign due dates using the calendar emoji (`📅`) followed by a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

```markdown
- [ ] Submit report 📅 2023-12-25
```

- **Calendar Picker**: Click the calendar icon and also the date text (`📅 2023-12-25`) in Live Preview mode to open a date picker menu and easily select or modify the due date.
  - **Configurable**: You can customize what kind of the emoji is used as the calendar icon (support start date emoji, scheduled date emoji, due date emoji, etc.) in the settings.

## Priorities

Assign priorities using specific emoji or the `priority` dataview-style inline field (`priority::`).

Common emoji used (configurable in settings):

- 🔺 Highest
- ⏫ High
- 🔼 Medium
- 🔽 Low
- ⏬ Lowest

Alternatively, use bracketed priorities like `[#A]`, `[#B]`, `[#C]`.

```markdown
- [ ] Urgent Task 🔺
- [ ] High priority task ⏫
- [ ] Normal task
- [ ] Low priority task [priority:: low]
- [ ] Another way [#B]
```

- **Priority Selector**: In Live Preview mode, click the priority icon (if present) to open a dropdown menu for quick selection.
- **Context Menu**: Right-click on a task line and use the `Task Genius: Set priority` submenu.
- **Commands**: Use commands like `Task Genius: Set priority A`, `Task Genius: Set priority B`, `Task Genius: Remove priority` via the command palette.
