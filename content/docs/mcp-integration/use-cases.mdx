This guide demonstrates real-world applications of Task Genius MCP integration, from simple daily workflows to complex automation scenarios.

## Daily Task Management

### Morning Planning Routine

Start your day by asking AI to organize your tasks:

```text
"Show me all tasks due today, sorted by priority. 
Include any overdue tasks from yesterday."
```

The AI will:
1. Query incomplete tasks due today
2. Find overdue tasks from previous days
3. Sort by priority (5 = highest)
4. Present a organized daily plan

**Behind the scenes:**
```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "query_tasks",
    "arguments": {
      "filter": {
        "completed": false,
        "dateRange": {
          "from": "2024-01-01",
          "to": "2024-01-15"
        }
      },
      "sort": {
        "field": "priority",
        "order": "desc"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### End-of-Day Review

Review what you accomplished:

```text
"What tasks did I complete today? 
Generate a summary for my daily log."
```

**Result:**
```markdown
## Daily Accomplishments - January 15, 2024

### Completed Tasks (7)
- ✅ [High] Review Q1 budget proposal
- ✅ [High] Client meeting preparation
- ✅ [Medium] Update project documentation
- ✅ [Medium] Code review for feature branch

### Progress Summary
- Completion rate: 70% (7/10 tasks)
- High-priority completion: 100% (2/2)
- Projects touched: Budget Planning, Client Relations, Development
```

### Weekly Planning

Prepare for the upcoming week:

```text
"Create a weekly overview: 
1. Tasks due this week by day
2. Project milestones
3. Recurring tasks to schedule"
```

## Project Management

### Sprint Planning

Set up a new sprint with AI assistance:

```text
"Create sprint tasks for Project Alpha:
- Setup development environment (Priority 5, Due: Monday)
- Design database schema (Priority 4, Due: Tuesday)
- Implement user authentication (Priority 5, Due: Thursday)
- Write unit tests (Priority 4, Due: Friday)
- Code review and merge (Priority 3, Due: Friday)
Tag all with #sprint-01 and +ProjectAlpha"
```

**MCP executes:**
```json
{
  "name": "batch_create_tasks",
  "arguments": {
    "defaultFilePath": "Projects/Sprint-01.md",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "content": "Setup development environment",
        "priority": 5,
        "dueDate": "2024-01-15",
        "project": "ProjectAlpha",
        "tags": ["sprint-01"]
      },
      // ... more tasks
    ]
  }
}
```

### Project Status Report

Generate project insights:

```text
"Analyze Project Alpha:
- How many tasks are complete vs incomplete?
- What high-priority items are overdue?
- What's the completion trend this month?"
```

**AI Response:**
```markdown
## Project Alpha Status Report

```

## Custom Workflows

### Personal Routines

Create personalized workflows:

```text
"My morning routine:
1. Check overdue tasks
2. Review today's calendar
3. Set 3 main priorities
4. Time block the morning
5. Create focus session for deep work"
```

### Context Switching

Manage context switches:

```text
"I'm switching from Project A to Project B:
1. Save current state of Project A tasks
2. Mark in-progress items
3. Load Project B context
4. Show Project B priorities
5. Suggest starting point"
```

### Review Cycles

Set up review processes:

```text
"Weekly review process:
1. List completed tasks
2. Identify incomplete high-priority items
3. Analyze why tasks weren't completed
4. Adjust next week's priorities
5. Archive completed project tasks"
```

## Tips for Effective Use

### 1. Start Simple
Begin with basic queries before complex automation:
- ❌ "Reorganize my entire task system"
- ✅ "Show today's high-priority tasks"

### 2. Be Specific
Provide clear criteria for better results:
- ❌ "Find important stuff"
- ✅ "Find tasks with priority 4-5 due this week"

### 3. Use Natural Language
The AI understands context:
- "What should I work on now?" 
- "Help me plan tomorrow"
- "I'm overwhelmed, prioritize my tasks"

### 4. Iterate and Refine
Adjust queries based on results:
1. Start broad: "Show project tasks"
2. Refine: "Show incomplete project tasks"
3. Focus: "Show incomplete high-priority project tasks due this week"

### 5. Create Templates
Save successful workflows:
```javascript
const dailyReview = `
  Show me:
  1. What I completed today
  2. What's still pending
  3. Tomorrow's priorities
  4. Any new urgent items
`;
```
