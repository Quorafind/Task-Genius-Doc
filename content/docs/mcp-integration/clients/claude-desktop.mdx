---

This guide shows you how to configure Claude Desktop to work with your Task Genius tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Desktop installed
- Task Genius MCP server enabled in Obsidian
- Your authentication credentials from Task Genius settings

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Locate Configuration File

Find your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS:**
```bash
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Windows:**
```bash
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Linux:**
```bash
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### Step 2: Create or Edit Configuration

If the file doesn't exist, create it with this structure:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-tasks": {
      "command": "curl",
      "args": [
        "-X", "POST",
        "-H", "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN+YOUR_APP_ID",
        "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
        "--data-raw", "@-",
        "http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Get Your Credentials

<DeepLinkButton href="obsidian://task-genius/settings?tab=mcp-integration">
  Open MCP Settings
</DeepLinkButton>

Copy:
1. Authentication Token
2. App ID
3. Server URL (if using custom port)

### Step 4: Update Configuration

Replace placeholders with your actual values:
- `YOUR_TOKEN` → Your authentication token
- `YOUR_APP_ID` → Your vault's App ID

### Step 5: Restart Claude Desktop

1. Completely quit Claude Desktop (not just close window)
2. Restart the application
3. The MCP server should connect automatically

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Vaults

Connect to multiple Obsidian vaults:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "personal-tasks": {
      "command": "curl",
      "args": [
        "-X", "POST",
        "-H", "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN1+APPID1",
        "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
        "--data-raw", "@-",
        "http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp"
      ]
    },
    "work-tasks": {
      "command": "curl",
      "args": [
        "-X", "POST",
        "-H", "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN2+APPID2",
        "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
        "--data-raw", "@-",
        "http://127.0.0.1:7778/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Remote Vault Access

For accessing a vault on another machine:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-vault": {
      "command": "curl",
      "args": [
        "-X", "POST",
        "-H", "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN+YOUR_APP_ID",
        "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
        "--data-raw", "@-",
        "http://192.168.1.100:7777/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


## Using Task Genius in Claude Desktop

Once configured, interact naturally with your tasks:

### Common Operations

```text
"Show today's high-priority tasks"
"Create task: Review quarterly report, priority 4, due tomorrow"
"Mark 'Review quarterly report' as complete"
"What tasks are overdue?"
"Show all tasks for project ClientPresentation"
"List tasks in @office context"
"Add task to today's daily note"
```

### Daily Workflows

```text
"Help me plan my day based on my tasks"
"What should I focus on this morning?"
"Show me overdue tasks that need attention"
"What did I complete yesterday?"
"Create a summary of this week's progress"
```

## Key Features

- **Context Awareness**: Claude remembers what you're discussing
- **Batch Operations**: Update multiple tasks at once
- **Smart Suggestions**: Get recommendations based on your task patterns
- **Natural Language**: No need to learn specific commands

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **Verify Task Genius MCP is running:**
   - Open Obsidian → Task Genius Settings → MCP Integration
   - Check server status is green

2. **Test connection:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7777/health
   ```

3. **Check configuration file:**
   - Ensure JSON syntax is valid
   - Verify token format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN+YOUR_APP_ID`
   - No extra spaces or quotes

### Authentication Errors

- **"Unauthorized"**: Invalid token or App ID
- **"Connection refused"**: MCP server not running
- **Solution**: Get fresh credentials from <a href="obsidian://task-genius/settings?tab=mcp-integration">MCP Settings</a>

### Windows-Specific

If curl isn't found, use full path:
```json
{
  "command": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\curl.exe"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Security**: Never share or commit your configuration file
2. **Naming**: Use descriptive names like `personal-tasks` or `work-projects`
3. **Conversations**: Start new chats for different task contexts
4. **Performance**: Be specific in queries for faster responses
