title: Task Status & Cycling
---

Go beyond the standard `- [ ]` (incomplete) and `- [x]` (complete) task markers. Task Genius allows you to define and use custom statuses to represent different stages of your workflow.

## Custom Statuses

Define your own markers in the plugin settings. Common examples include:

- `[/]` for "In Progress"
- `[?]` for "Planned" or "On Hold"
- `[-]` for "Abandoned" or "Cancelled"

These custom statuses can be configured to be included or excluded from progress bar calculations (see [[Progress Bars]]).

## Cycling Statuses

Easily transition tasks between statuses:

- **Clicking**: In Live Preview or Reading mode, click directly on a task marker (e.g., `[ ]`, `[x]`, `[/]`) to cycle it to the next configured status (if enabled in settings).
- **Commands**: Use the Obsidian command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and search for:
  - `Task Genius: Cycle task status forward`
  - `Task Genius: Cycle task status backward`

## Configuration

In the Task Genius settings, you can:

- Define the characters used for custom statuses (e.g., `x`, `/`, `?`, `-`).
- Configure which statuses are counted as "done", "incomplete", or ignored for progress calculations.
- Choose visual themes or styles for different statuses.
- Set up specific cycling sequences (e.g., define the order statuses change when clicked or using commands).
