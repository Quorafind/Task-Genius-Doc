title: In-Editor Task Filtering
---

Focus on the tasks that matter within a specific note without leaving the editor. Task Genius provides a dynamic filtering panel.

## Usage

1.  Open the Obsidian command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`).
2.  Run the command: `Task Genius: Toggle task filter panel` (Note: You need to focus on the editor first).
3.  A panel will appear (usually at the top or side of the editor pane) with filtering options.

## Filtering Options

Use the panel to filter the tasks displayed in the current editor based on:

- **Status**: Show only tasks with specific statuses (e.g., `[ ]`, `[/]`, `[x]`).
- **Content**: Filter by text or tags present in the task line (e.g., `#projectA`, `urgent`).
- **Relationships**: Filter based on task hierarchy:
  - Show only parent tasks.
  - Show only child tasks.
  - Show tasks related to the current cursor position (parent/children/siblings).

## Presets

- **Save**: If you frequently use a specific set of filter criteria, you can save them as a named preset within the panel.
- **Load**: Quickly apply previously saved presets.

## Toggling

Use the same command (`Task Genius: Toggle task filter panel`) or a button within the panel itself to hide the filters and show all tasks again.

Usually, you can toggle the filter panel on the top-right corner of the editor view.
