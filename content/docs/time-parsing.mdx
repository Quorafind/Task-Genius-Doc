## Overview

Task Genius provides comprehensive time parsing that goes beyond basic date recognition to include:

- **Single Times**: Specific times like `12:00`, `2:30 PM`, `14:30:00`
- **Time Ranges**: Duration blocks like `9:00-17:00`, `2:30 PM - 4:00 PM`
- **Date + Time Combinations**: Full scheduling like `2024-12-25 14:30` or `tomorrow 3pm`
- **Time-Only Expressions**: Times without dates that inherit context intelligently

### Interface Options
- **Desktop**: Uses a popover date/time picker for quick selection
- **Mobile**: Uses a modal with the same functionality

## Supported Time Formats

### Single Times

Task Genius recognizes various time formats for precise scheduling:

#### 24-Hour Format
<TimeParsingExample>

```markdown
- [ ] Meeting ðŸ“… 14:30
- [ ] Call client ðŸ“… 09:15:00
- [ ] Lunch break ðŸ“… 12:00
```

</TimeParsingExample>

#### 12-Hour Format with AM/PM
<TimeParsingExample>

```markdown
- [ ] Morning standup ðŸ“… 9:00 AM
- [ ] Afternoon review ðŸ“… 2:30 PM
- [ ] Evening workout ðŸ“… 6:00:00 PM
```

</TimeParsingExample>

#### Combined Date and Time
<TimeParsingExample>

```markdown
- [ ] Project deadline ðŸ“… 2024-12-25 23:59
- [ ] Doctor appointment ðŸ“… tomorrow 2:30 PM
- [ ] Team meeting ðŸ“… next friday 10:00 AM
```

</TimeParsingExample>

### Time Ranges

For tasks that span a duration, use time ranges with various separators:

#### Standard Range Formats
<TimeParsingExample variant="range">

```markdown
- [ ] Workshop ðŸ“… 9:00-17:00
- [ ] Conference call ðŸ“… 2:30 PM - 4:00 PM  
- [ ] Study session ðŸ“… 14:00~16:30
- [ ] Office hours ðŸ“… 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM
```

</TimeParsingExample>

#### Midnight Crossing Ranges
<TimeParsingExample variant="range">

```markdown
- [ ] Night shift ðŸ“… 23:00-07:00
- [ ] Late project work ðŸ“… 22:30 - 01:30
```

</TimeParsingExample>

### Time-Only Expressions

When you specify times without explicit dates, Task Genius intelligently determines the appropriate date using this priority order:

1. **Current Line Date**: Date mentioned in the same line
2. **File Metadata Date**: Date from frontmatter or file properties  
3. **Daily Note Date**: Date extracted from daily note title/path
4. **File Creation Time**: When the file was created

#### Examples
<TimeParsingExample variant="inheritance">

```markdown
# 2024-12-25 Daily Note
- [ ] Morning coffee ðŸ“… 8:00 AM    # Uses 2024-12-25
- [ ] Team sync ðŸ“… 10:30-11:00     # Uses 2024-12-25

## Project Tasks
- [ ] Code review ðŸ“… 14:00         # Inherits from daily note date
```

</TimeParsingExample>

## Supported Date Inputs

In addition to enhanced time parsing, all existing date formats continue to work:

### Natural Language
- `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`
- `next monday`, `next week`, `next month`
- `in 2 days`, `in 3 weeks`, `in 1 hour`

### Explicit Formats
- `2025-09-30`, `09/30/2025`
- `Dec 25, 2024`, `25 December 2024`

### Combined Examples
<TimeParsingExample variant="combined">

```markdown
- [ ] Project kickoff ðŸ“… next monday 9:00 AM
- [ ] Deadline ðŸ“… in 2 weeks 17:00
- [ ] Review meeting ðŸ“… tomorrow 14:30-15:30
```

</TimeParsingExample>

## Timeline View Enhancements

The enhanced time parsing significantly improves the Timeline view experience:

### Chronological Ordering
- Tasks with specific times appear in chronological order within each day
- Time-only tasks are sorted by their actual parsed times (not defaulting to 00:00)
- Tasks without times appear separately or with default time indicators

### Time Range Visualization
- Tasks with time ranges show the start time prominently
- Range duration is displayed when viewing task details
- Visual indicators distinguish between single times and ranges

### Time-Based Grouping
- Tasks at the same time are grouped together
- Clear separation between timed and untimed tasks
- Improved readability for daily schedule overview

## Editor Interactions

### Live Preview Mode
- Click date icons/markers to open the time picker
- Time components are highlighted and editable
- Real-time validation of time formats

### Source Mode
- Direct text editing with format validation
- Auto-completion for common time patterns
- Syntax highlighting for recognized time expressions

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Follow your editor environment settings
- Quick time insertion commands available
- Tab completion for time formats

## Settings & Configuration

### Time Format Preferences
- **Default Format**: Choose between 12-hour and 24-hour display
- **AM/PM Handling**: Set default period for ambiguous times
- **Range Separators**: Customize which separators to recognize

### Parsing Behavior
- **Midnight Crossing**: How to handle ranges that span midnight
- **Fallback Strategy**: What to do when time parsing fails
- **Date Inheritance**: Priority order for time-only expressions

### Locale Support
- Locale-aware parsing respects your system settings
- Regional time format preferences
- Internationalized error messages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Time Not Recognized
**Problem**: Your time format isn't being parsed
**Solutions**:
- Try explicit formats: `14:30` instead of `2:30`
- Add AM/PM for 12-hour times: `2:30 PM`
- Check for typos in separators: `-` vs `â€“` vs `~`

#### Wrong Date Applied
**Problem**: Time-only expressions get unexpected dates
**Solutions**:
- Add explicit date: `2024-12-25 14:30`
- Check file metadata for conflicting dates
- Verify daily note date format in filename

#### Timeline Display Issues
**Problem**: Tasks appear at wrong times in timeline
**Solutions**:
- Refresh the timeline view
- Check time format consistency
- Verify timezone settings in Obsidian

#### Range Parsing Problems
**Problem**: Time ranges not recognized properly
**Solutions**:
- Use standard separators: `-`, ` - `, or `~`
- Ensure both times use same format (both 24h or both 12h)
- Check for midnight crossing configuration

### Format Validation

If a time expression isn't recognized:
1. **Try explicit formats**: Use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` for guaranteed parsing
2. **Check locale settings**: Confirm your system/Obsidian locale matches expected format
3. **Use standard separators**: Stick to `-`, ` - `, or `~` for ranges
4. **Verify AM/PM**: Always include AM/PM for 12-hour format times

### Performance Considerations

For large vaults with many tasks:
- Time parsing is optimized for performance
- File metadata is cached to avoid repeated file system access
- Background processing handles bulk time parsing operations

## Migration from Basic Time Parsing

Existing tasks with basic time information are automatically enhanced:
- Previous date-only tasks continue to work unchanged
- Tasks with basic time info get enhanced time components
- No manual migration required - enhancement happens automatically
- All existing functionality remains backward compatible

## Best Practices

### Consistent Formatting
- Choose either 12-hour or 24-hour format and stick with it
- Use the same range separator throughout your vault
- Be explicit with AM/PM when using 12-hour format

### Effective Time Ranges
- Use ranges for tasks that have a specific duration
- Consider using single times for deadlines or start times
- Leverage midnight crossing for shift work or late-night tasks

### Date Inheritance Optimization
- Use daily notes for time-only task organization
- Set file metadata dates for project-specific task files
- Organize tasks hierarchically to benefit from parent date inheritance
