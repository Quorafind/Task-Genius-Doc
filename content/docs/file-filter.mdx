## Include / Exclude

- Include folders/files to explicitly index
- Exclude folders/files to skip from indexing
- Patterns should be kept simple and reviewed periodically

## Interactions With Other Filters

- Global filtering (Tasks/Views) can further restrict items
- File Filter is evaluated early; downstream filters only see remaining items

## Performance Notes

- Broad include/exclude patterns can be expensive on large vaults
- Prefer narrower folder scopes and explicit includes when possible

## Troubleshooting

- Unexpected items? Re-check both File Filter and view-level filters
- After changes, force reindex if necessary: “Task Genius: Force reindex all tasks”
