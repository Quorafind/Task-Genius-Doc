title: Quick Capture
---

import { VersionCallout } from "@/components/VersionCallout";

Quickly jot down tasks or notes and send them to a designated file without interrupting your current workflow.

<VersionCallout version="6.0.0" />

## Methods

Task Genius offers several ways to capture information:

1.  **Inline Panel**:

    - Use the command `Task Genius: Toggle quick capture panel` or the default hotkey (`Alt+C`).
    - A small input panel appears at the bottom of the current editor.
    - Type your task or note and press `Enter` to send it to your configured capture file.

2.  **Global Command**:

    - Use the command `Task Genius: Quick capture (Global)`.
    - This opens a modal window where you can type your task/note.
    - This command can often be assigned to a global hotkey in Obsidian's settings, allowing capture from anywhere, even outside Obsidian.

<VersionCallout version="7.0.0" />

3.  **Detailed Capture Modal**:
    - Use the command `Task Genius: Task capture with metadata`.
    - This opens a more comprehensive modal allowing you to add details like due dates, priorities, tags, or project links directly during capture.

In the Task Genius settings, define how Quick Capture behaves:

- **Target File**: Specify the path to the file where captured items will be saved (e.g., `Inbox.md`, `Quick Notes.md`).
- **Append/Prepend/Replace**: Choose how new captures are added to the target file (add to the end, beginning, or replace a specific section).
- **Formatting**: Define templates or formatting for captured items (e.g., automatically add `- [ ]` for tasks, include timestamps).
