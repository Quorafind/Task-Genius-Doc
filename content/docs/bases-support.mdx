<VersionCallout version="9.8.0" />

Task Genius now fully supports [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases), the core plugin introduced in Obsidian 1.9.0 that allows you to create database-like views of your notes. This integration extends Task Genius's powerful task management capabilities to work seamlessly with Obsidian's native file indexing system.

## What are Bases?

Bases is a core Obsidian plugin that lets you create database-like views of your notes. Using a base, you can view, edit, sort, and filter files and their properties. Each base can have several views with different layouts such as tables and cards.

All data in Obsidian Bases is stored in your local Markdown files and their properties. The views are described by the Bases syntax, which can be saved as a `.base` file or embedded in code blocks within your Markdown files.

## Task Genius Integration

Task Genius extends Bases functionality by:

### 1. **Base View Support**

You can now select any existing Task Genius view as a view type within a Base. This means you can use:
- Inbox View
- Forecast View
- Project View
- Tag View
- Review View
- Flag View
- Event View (Calendar)
- Status View
- Habit View
- Plan View (Gantt)
- Matrix View
- Custom Views

### 2. **Enhanced Data Sources**

Task Genius supports default source from base view:
- **Bases Data Source**: Leverages Obsidian's native file indexing
- **Note Properties**: Uses file properties as task metadata
- **File-as-Task**: Treats entire notes as tasks when used in a Base

### 3. **Seamless Property Mapping**
Task Genius automatically maps common file properties to task attributes:
- `due` → Due date
- `scheduled` → Scheduled date
- `status` → Task status
- `priority` → Task priority
- `tags` → Task tags
- `project` → Project assignment

## How to Use

### Creating a Task Genius Base View

1. **Create a new Base** or open an existing one
2. **Add a new view** to your Base
3. **Select a Task Genius view type** from the available options
4. **Configure the view settings** as you would in the standard Task Genius interface

### Using File Properties

You can leverage file properties to enhance task management:

```yaml
